Daniel Eden is a Designer with a penchant for the web, typography, and
interaction design. He prefers to refer to himself in the first person.

I’m currently living and working in San Francisco as a Designer and Web Engineer
for [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com "Dropbox"), where I'm helping rearchitect CSS,
providing developer tools for the company's engineers, and fostering
collaboration between the Design and Engineering teams.

I spend my time [Tweeting](http://twitter.com/_dte "@_dte on Twitter"),
taking [photographs](https://www.instagram.com/_dte/ "@_dte on Instagram"),
and [writing code](https://github.com/daneden "daneden on GitHub").

I'm currently unavailable for work, but you can take a look at
[my résumé](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kq431p4ey1b1ayu/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.pdf
"Daniel Eden’s résumé") anyway.
